Learning-Projects---PYTHON
==========================

All of the little challenges and tinkering I do in python not linked to any other thing


All of these are done by someone that is still very new to this language

If you are trying to learn then I feel good, if you are trying to teach then you should feel good.

If you are trying to steal anything, you should just feel ashamed that you can't duplicate begginner software and kill yourself.
